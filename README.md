# MyVim
Its a Windows VIM which contains all the necessary plugins and the Vimrc file. 
Get this config, nice color schemes and lots of plugins !

** I have copied the VIM files which I am using in my Windows setup. Any windows 
users can just copy the Vim plugins into the respective folder and copy the _vimrc 
file. This will work wonderfully. 

This is configured as a beautiful Source Code browser with Press of F8 key.
